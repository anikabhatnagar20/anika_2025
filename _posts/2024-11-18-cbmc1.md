# CB REFLECTION: 38/40 
- Question 6:  almostEqual method

The other options don’t work because they either don’t properly check the difference or use unrelated calculations, like averaging the numbers. For example, Option A only works if d1≥d2, and B and D compare the average of the numbers, which has nothing to do with their closeness. Option C is completely opposite to the goal because it checks if the difference is greater than the tolerance instead of less. Option E is correct because it accurately checks if the two numbers are close enough by comparing their absolute difference to the tolerance.


- Question 34: Point and circle classes

Option A only checks `d1 - d2`, which doesn't work when `d1 < d2` since the difference becomes negative. Options B and D incorrectly use the average of `d1` and `d2`, which has no relation to how close the two values are. Option C checks if the difference is greater than or equal to the tolerance, which is the opposite of the intended logic. E is the only correct option because it compares the absolute difference of `d1` and `d2` to the tolerance, which is the proper way to determine if two numbers are close enough to be considered equal.

## Questions that I struggles with
- Question 14

The correct answer is E. v.getMileage() because v represents each Vehicle object in the myVehicles list as the for loop iterates through it. Calling v.getMileage() correctly retrieves the mileage for each vehicle. The other options are wrong because they misuse syntax or concepts. Option A assumes getMileage is a static method, which it’s not. Option B tries to use array-style indexing on a list, which is invalid. Option C incorrectly assumes a nonexistent static get() method in the Vehicle interface. Option D tries to call myVehicles.get(v), but get() expects an index, not an object. Only E follows the correct Java syntax for accessing the getMileage() method on each Vehicle object.

- Question 40

This recursive method takes a string and repeatedly removes its last character until the string length is 1, printing the intermediate results as it unwinds from the recursion. The process starts with the string "WATCH." The method first checks if the length of the string is greater than 1; since it is, it creates a substring excluding the last character ("WATC") and recursively calls the method with that substring. This process continues, creating "WAT," "WA," and "W" in subsequent recursive calls. Once the string length is 1 ("W"), the recursion stops, and the method begins printing the substrings as it returns from the recursive calls. The printed output

## overall reflection 
The hardest questions for me were the ones that involved tricky concepts like recursion and multi-way selection logic. For example, problems like seqSearchRecHelper change and compute method with parameters n and k were challenging because they required me to carefully think through how the code would work step by step. These types of questions tested my understanding of how to handle complex logic and edge cases.
One thing I still need to work on is understanding recursive methods better. I was able to get the right answers, but I often needed help or had to look things up online. I also found questions about interfaces, like Vehicle interface getMileage, to be tricky because I need to improve my knowledge of object-oriented programming concepts. Practicing these areas more will help me feel more confident solving similar problems on my own

A topic that was harder for me were recursion. 
Notes/Learned: 
Recursion is a technique where a method or function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a larger problem. 
It has two main parts:
Base Case: The condition where the recursion stops to prevent infinite calls (when a specific value is reached).
Recursive Case: The part where the function calls itself with modified inputs to break the problem into smaller parts.
Recursion is commonly used in tasks like calculating, traversing data structures, and solving problems with repetitive patterns.
Some of the questions I found easy were those involving straightforward logic or basic operations, like sumArray with 1D int array and Print odd integers in 1D array but not even. These types of problems required simple loops or conditional checks, which I am comfortable with. I also found questions about instantiating objects, like Instantiation of Student objects, to be easy because they followed basic object-oriented programming principles that I’ve practiced before.
