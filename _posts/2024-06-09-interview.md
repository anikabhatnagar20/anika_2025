## Introduction
My name is Anika Bhatnagar and I and a junior in highschool. I’m passionate about using code to solve real-world problems and create tools that help people. Something that makes me stand out is my hardworking personality and presentation abilities. 

## Technical Experience
### Projects 
#### Hall Pass
- Created a digital hall pass that tracks student movement and reduces paper waste
- Focused on frontend (JavaScript) and backend/database integration
- Learned to connect logic between UI and backend storage
- Presented this at Night of the Museum with great feedback from staff and students


### Skills in language 
- JavaScript (event handling, DOM manipulation, localStorage/backend logic)
- HTML & CSS (interface building and styling)
- Python 
- Gained experience with GitHub and debugging


## Growth 
## Presentations 
- Presented Digital Hall Pass at Night of the Museum (answered questions, explained the tech/overview of how code works clearly)
- Took part in team teaches (explained concepts to peers, learned to communicate technical topics)
- Comfortable speaking to groups and adapting to feedback
## Future Projects/Goals
- I’ve recently started getting involved in an exciting biomechanics project at Westview High School, led by Mrs. Hester in collaboration with USC. The project focuses on analyzing athletic movements—like softball swings and jumps—using force plates and motion capture technology. The goal is to create an interactive exhibit for the California Science Center that breaks down the physics behind these movements in a way younger students can understand. I’m looking forward to contributing to this unique blend of science, sports, and tech!
