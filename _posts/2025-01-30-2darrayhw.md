If you are interested in the extra credit, you can answer below:
Extra Credit 1: The time complexity of maxSquare is O(N^2*M^2), This is because we iterate over all possible square sizes, all starting rows, and all starting columns. For each square, we sum the elements inside it, which takes O(size^2) where size is the square length.
Extra Credit 3: The time complexity of maxSubarraySum is O(N*M) Flattening the 2D array into a 1D array takes O(N*M) and running Kadane's algorithm on the flattened array also takes O(N*M) since it processes each element once.
