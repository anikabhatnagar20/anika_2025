## Unit 1: Primitive Types
Variables: I practiced declaring and using variables like int for numbers, double for decimals, and boolean for true/false values. I also worked on how to initialize and assign values properly.
Errors: The homework taught me to catch common mistakes like using the wrong data type in calculations, which caused errors in my code.
Takeaway: Always double-check data types and remember how to convert between them (e.g., int to double). Fixing these helped me avoid runtime errors.

## Unit 2: Using Objects
- Objects represent real-world entities in programming.
- Methods define object behavior.
- Encapsulation hides data within objects.
- Constructors initialize new object instances.
- Accessors and mutators (getters/setters) manage object data.
Objects: I practiced creating objects and calling methods on them, especially working with strings. Using methods like substring() and charAt() helped me manipulate strings efficiently.
Takeaway: Strings are immutable, so when I used substring or concat, it was important to remember that they return new strings rather than modifying the original. This helped me understand memory management better.

## Unit 3: Boolean Expressions and if Statements
- Boolean expressions evaluate to either true or false.
- Logical operators include AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).
- Used for decision-making (if-else statements).
- Relational operators compare values (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=).
- Critical for loops and flow control in programs.
If-else Logic: I got a lot of practice writing conditional logic using if, else if, and else statements. The exercises helped me understand how to use boolean operators like && (and) and || (or).
Takeaway: Simplifying conditions with boolean operators made my code more readable and efficient. Using De Morgan's Law helped me reduce complex conditions.

## Unit 4: Iteration (Loops)
- Loops allow repeated execution of a block of code.
- Types of loops: for, while, and do-while.
- Loops can iterate over arrays or lists of items.
- Break and continue can control loop execution.
- Used to simplify repetitive tasks in code.
Loops: I worked on both for and while loops to repeat tasks, especially focusing on making sure loops don’t run forever. Debugging infinite loops was a major learning point.
Takeaway: It’s crucial to ensure that loops have a proper exit condition, or they could go on forever. I practiced breaking down problems into smaller steps using loops.

## Unit 5: Writing Classes
- Classes define blueprints for objects.
- Each class contains fields (attributes) and methods.
- Constructors create instances of classes (objects).
- Static methods/fields belong to the class, not instances.
- Inheritance allows creating new classes from existing ones.
Class Design: I learned how to structure a class with fields, constructors, and methods. Using private fields and public methods to control access helped me understand encapsulation better.
Takeaway: Proper use of encapsulation made my classes more secure and easier to maintain. I now use getter and setter methods regularly to control data access.

## Unit 6: Arrays
- Arrays store multiple elements of the same type.
- Elements are accessed using zero-based index numbers.
- Fixed size; cannot change once declared.
- Useful for managing lists or collections of data.
- Common operations: iteration, sorting, and searching.
Array Basics: I practiced creating arrays, accessing elements by index, and performing operations like summing values. I also had to be careful with array bounds to avoid errors.
Takeaway: Arrays start at index 0, and it’s easy to make off-by-one errors, so I practiced double-checking my loop conditions to prevent going out of bounds.

## Unit 7: ArrayList
- ArrayLists are dynamic arrays in Java.
- Unlike arrays, ArrayLists can change size dynamically.
- ArrayLists store objects, not primitive types.
- Useful methods: add(), remove(), get(), size(). 
- ArrayLists offer more flexibility than basic arrays.
Dynamic Lists: I worked with ArrayList and learned how to dynamically add, remove, and access elements. It’s much more flexible than arrays, especially when the size of the list changes frequently.
Takeaway: ArrayList methods like add() and remove() made my code more dynamic and flexible. I prefer ArrayList when I don’t know the exact size of the list beforehand.

## Unit 8: 2D Arrays
- 2D arrays are arrays of arrays (matrix structure).
- Rows and columns are used to access elements.
- Useful for representing grids, tables, and matrices.
- Common operations: iterating over rows and columns.
- Indexed by two values: row index and column index.
2D Arrays: Using nested loops to access elements in a 2D array was key in this unit. I practiced matrix operations like summing rows and columns.
Takeaway: Nested loops are essential for working with 2D arrays. I practiced breaking down complex problems into smaller tasks to handle both rows and columns efficiently.
