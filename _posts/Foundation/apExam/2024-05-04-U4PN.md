**While loop** 
- While loop is written with an expression called a condition that evaluated to a boolean and a block of code which is executed repeatedly 
- Basically if statement but keeps repeating 
 while (some condition) { 
	//block of code to repeat 
} 
Example: 
Int personAge = 0; 
while (personAge<24) { 
	System.out.println(“your cannot rent a car in the US”);
	personsAge ++; // adds 1 each time 
} 
- This will print you can not legally rent a car in the US many times until the personsAge variable is greater or equal to 24. 

**For loop** 
- A for loop includes the initialization of a variable, a condition that evaluates to a boolean, and a statement to update the initialized variable 
- Literally the same as while loop except it happens in 1 line 
for (*initilize a variable; some condition; change statement){
	//block of code
} 
Example 
for (int personsAge = 0; personsAge < 100; personsAge++){
	System.out.println(“You are:” + personsAge + “years old”);

**Nested for loops** 
- Loops can include other loops inside them 
for (int i=0; i<10; i++)[
	For int j = 0; j < 10; j++) { 
// do something 
} 
}
