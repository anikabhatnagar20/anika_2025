**Testing equality** 
- The == operator tests if 2 primitive types or two references are equal 
2==2 is true 
(4+5) == 9 is true 
String myName= “Charlie” 
String myNameAgain = “Charlie”
myName == myNameAgain; //not true you cant do == on classes  
- The !=operator tests if 2 primitive types or 2 references are not equal 
- Think about the same examples but flip the trues/falses
2 != 2 is false
**If statements**
if (*some condition here*) {
// stuff that happens if condition was true 
} 

If else statements 
if (*some condition here*) {
	// block that runs if the condition was true 
} else {
// block that runs if the condition was false 
}
**Nested ifs** 
if (*first condition here*) {
// stuff that happens if the first condition was true 
If (*second condition here*) { 
// stuff that happens if the second condition was true 
}
}  

**Else if statements** 
if (*First condition here*) {
	// block that runs if the condition was true 
} else if (*second condition here*) {
// block that runs if the first condition was false but the second was true
}

**Boolean expressions** 
- &&- and 
- Evaluates to true if both sides are true 
- ||- or 
- Evaluates to true if either side was true 
- ! - not 
- Evaluates to true if the expression is false
**Comparing objects** 
- If you are comparing ints, doubles, or booleans, use == or != 
myNumber == 7 
- If you are comparing objects(including Strings), use the .equals() method
myString.equals(myOtherString)
