**Inheritance**
- A parent class(super class) has some attributes and methods 
- A child class(sub class) has all of the same attributes and methods, but it can add more to the parent class
- Example: vehicle is parent class, car and motorcycle are chld classes 
 Many of teh things u can do with a car u can do with a vehicle 
But a car and motorcycle r different 
 A car is a vehicle (inheritence) 
A car has wheels(not inheritance)

**Generalization vs Specialization** 
- The superclass is more generalized 
- The subclass is more specialized 
- Example: superclass= shape subclass= triangle

**Inheritance and constructors** 
public class employee extends Person ( 
	Public Employee() { 
		Super (); // calls teh person() constructor 
	} 
	Public Employee(String theName){
	super(theName); // calls Person(theName) constructor
}
} 
**Overloading methods** 
- Overriding methods is a supeclass and a subclass having the same method 
- Overloading is the same class having 2 methods with the same name but different parameters 

**Super keyword** 
- The super() keyword allows a subclass’s method to call the superclass’s method 

**Polymorphism** 
- Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass through inheritance. 
- It lets the same method name behave differently depending on teh object calling it. 
- Imagine having a general class called animal, and several subclasses like dog, cat and bird, that inherit from it. All the animals can speak but do it differently. 

**The object superclass** 
- Object is the superclass of all java classes 
- All objects have the methods 
- String toString()
- Boolean equals(Object other)
