**Recursion**
- When a method calls itself 
- Recursion is an alternative way of doing a loop 
**Countdown Example**
Void countdown(int numTimes){
	System.out.print(numTimes);
	if (numTimes>0) { 
		countdown(numTimes -1); 
    }
}
- This is an example of a recursive function that prints numbers counting down 
countdown(5) calls countdown(4)
countdown(4) calls countdown(3)
countdown(3) calls countdown(2)
countdown(2) calls countdown(1)
countdown(1) calls countdown(0)
countdown(0) calls nothing 

**Base case vs recursive case** 
- Recursive case is the part of the recursive method that calls teh method itself 
- The base case is part of the recursive function that does not call itself
- FIRST THING U DO IS WRITE THE BASE CASE
