**System.out.print vs system.out.println** 

- System.out.printSystem.out.print 

System.out.println 
System.out.print  

**Errors**

- Syntax error: messed up on something you typed 

- Logic error: code doenst do what it needs to 

- Debugging: fixing errors 

**Comments in Java** 
// comments 
/* multiline comment 
* comment 
*/

- The text in comments is ignored by java and wont impact the program 

**String literal**
- Is just the text surrounded by quotes 
Example: 
“Hello” 
**Main method** 
- The thing that starts off any java program 
- When running code the main method gets called and runs it looks like: 
class Main {
	public static void main(String [ ] args) {
System.out.println(“Hello world!”); 
//code here  
- Class just has to have the same name as the file
**Variables**
- A variable is a name associated with a empty location in the computar 
- Basically lets u store information to use later 
- In java all variables have a name, type, and value 
- Variables are declared 
- Given a name and type 
- And then initialized 
- Given a starting value 
- The first thing is the type, then name, equal sign, and then the value
String exampleVariable = “this is an example” 
Type: string
Name: exampleVariable
Value: ”this is an example” 

**Assignment Statments** 
- An Assignement statement changes the value of a variable. After an assignment statement the old value is gone forever 
String myname = “charles” 
System.out. println(myName); 
Charles 
myName = “Charlie”; // this is an assignment statement 
System.out.println(myName);
Charlie 
- Basically just changing the value of a variable 

**Concatenation** 
- Joining together 2 pieces of information 
- In java u do this with plus sign 
System.out.println(“Hello” + “World”); 
HelloWorld 

**Expressions** 
- An expression combines information to get a new value 
- When an expression is evaluated we get a value 
2+2 evaluates to 4 
“Hello” + “world” evaluates to Hello world 
2*(3+5)= 16 

**Casting**
- How we convert things from 1 type to another 
- Basically just do this between number types 
- Put the type you want to convert in parentheses after the equals sign
In roundedDownInt =(int) 1.5 +2.2; // will round down to 3, it changes 3.7(double) to int 
Double answer = 5/(double) 2; //converts 2 to 2.0
