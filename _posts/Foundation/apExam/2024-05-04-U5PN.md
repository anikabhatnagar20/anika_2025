**Class review:** 
- When u make a class in java you are creating a new data type that has attributes(variables) and behavoirs(methods) 
- A single instance of a class is called an object 

**Anatomy of a class** 
public class person { //name of the class 
/* *instance variable declarations* */ 
	Private String name; //instance variable 
	Private int age;  //instance variable 
/* Constructor - same name as the class no return type */
Public Person () { //constructor 
/* Implementation not shown */
}
}

**Constructor** 
- A constructor is called to create an instance of a class- this means setting it up properly 
- Usually this means the constructor will have parameters that let u set up the instance variable with data 
**Public and private** 
- A public instance variable or method can be accessed by any code by using objectName.variableName or objectName.methidName(); 
- A private instance variable or method can only be accessed within the class 
- Using private members is called encapsulation, since the objects hides or “encapsulates” its private data 

**Getters and Setters(accessors and mutators)** 
- A getter returns an instance variable 
- Alot of methods look like this 
public String getName() { 
	return name; 
} 
Other method is setter which changes an instance variable
Void means it doesnt return anything 
public void setName(String newName) { 
	name = newName; 
} 

 **Writing Methods** 
- Every method besides constructor needs a name, a return type and a list of formal parameters 
- Void is a return type that means that the method won't return anything 

**Call by value vs call by reference** 
- Pass by value: when an actual parameter is a primitive type changing the parameter wontg do anything to the methods caller 
- Pass by reference: when an actual parameter is not a primitive(some class< using its methods can change the original back for the caller 

**Static Variables and methods** 
- Static variable/method exists once per calss 
- Individual objects cant change it 
- You can access static variables with: className.variable 
- You can access static methods with: className.method()

**Scope and access** 
- Instance variables have class scope 
- You can use them anywhere in a class 
- Formal parameters have method scope 
- You can use them anywhere inside that method 
- Loop variables and other variables have block scope 
- Use them anywhere in that block
