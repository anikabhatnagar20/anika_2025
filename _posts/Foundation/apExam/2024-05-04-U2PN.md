**Classes and Objects**
- When u make a class your making a new data type
- Classes have variables and methods you can call 
- You can make a class to represent anything 
- An object is an instance of a class and you can put an object in a viarbale 
- Example: if theres a class Person you could make a mrMeyer Person object, a serenaWilliams Person object or a joeBiden Person object
Person mrMeyer = new person(); 
Person goes in the spot of variable type (int, string, double) 
mrMeyer is an object 

**Instance Variable and methods** 
- An instance vairable is a piece of data that belongs to an object 
- A method is a piece of code(function) that can be called so that an object does something 
Example(Person class) 
- Instance variables: name, age, bday, 
- Methods: say Hi, walkToSTore
**Constructors** 
- A constructor is a method that makes a new instance of a class 
- You call it like this, with the new key word in front: 
Person joeBiden = new person (); 
- This line of code declares a variable called joeBiden. joeBiden is intilialized with a new instance of the person class, which is created by calling the constructor. 

**Constructor signatures** 
- A methods signature defines teh parameters that you need to call the method. 
- This is just a list of names and types 
public Person(String personName, int theirAge) { 
name = personsName; 
Age = theirAge; 
} 
- The signature is that whole first line
- The stuff in the parentheses is called the parameter list 

**Formal and actual parameters** 
- Formal parameters are the names and type of parameters
Public Person(string personsName, int theirAge) { 
	name = personsName; 
age = theirAge; 
} 
- Actual parameters(arguements) are the values of the parameters when a method is called 
- Example joeBiden = new Person(“joe”, 75);

**Calling methods** 
- Calling method makes the code in that method happen 
- It looks like this  
objectNAme.methodname(); 
- Examples: joeBiden.sayHi();
- When the method is called the code for that method is called and the variables for that specific object will be used in the code

**Calling method with parameters** 
- If a method has formal parameters you need to call it and give it the value of teh actual parameters 
Person joe = new Person (“Joe Biden”, 75) 
- The person Joe biden and 75 are the values of the actual parameters and you put them in teh same order as teh formal parameters asked for.  

**Methods that return values** 
- A method can have a return types which says what type of value it will return 
- A method returns whatever value comes afterthe return keyword 
- The value that gets returned hoes back to where the method was called 
- Example: 
double divideByTen(double x) { 
	Return x/10; 
} 
// somewhere else…
Double myExampleDouble = thing.divideByTen(120.0)
System.out.println(myExampleDouble);
12
- 3 types of methods that you can write code for in a class
- Constructor: Making the object 
- Void : Basically printing 50%
- Changing the value for an instance variable 50%
- Non void : Type defined on the method is somethong other than the word void 
**String objects** 
- String is usually a class in Java 
- Whenever u make a string variable your making an instance of the string class 
- Strings have a ton of methods 

**Math class/Static method** 
- The math class is static so its just a bunch of methods you can call without having to make an instance of an object 
- To call a static method on a class just do ClassName.mthod(); 
double myDouble = Math.random(); 

**All Vocab** 
- Class - defines a new data type 
- Its the formal blueprint of the attributes/behaviors of the objects of that class
- Object- a specific instance of a class with defined attributes 
- Objects are declared as variables of a class type 
- Constructors- code that used to create new objects and initialize the objects’s attributes 
- New- keyword used to create objects with a call to one of the class’s constructors 
- Instance variables- define the attributes for objects 
- Methods- define the behavior or function for objects 
- dot(.) operator- used to access an objects methods 
- parameters(arguement)- the value or data passed to an object’s method inside the parentheses in the method call to help the method do its job 
- Return value- value returned by methods to the calling method 
- Wrapper class- classes that create objects from primitive types 
- Example the integer class and double class
