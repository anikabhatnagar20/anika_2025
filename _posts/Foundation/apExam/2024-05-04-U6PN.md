**Arrays**
- A way to store multiple pieces of data 
- Everything in an array must be the same type 
- Declaring an array: 
Int[] scores; 
String [] names; 

**Initializing an array:** 
- Initializing an empty array: 
int[] highScores = new int[5] //initializes an array of 5 ints 
String[] highScores = new String[25] //initializes an array of 25 strings 
- Initiliazing an array w stuff in it :
string[] food = { “Apple”, “Banana”, “Pear”, “Plum”}; 
**Lists and loops almost always go together 
Important to memorize this structure** 
String[] animals = {“elephant”, “giraffe”, “aardvark”}; // declaring the variable type:string, variable generally plural, then use curly brackets to full the list. 
For (int i = 0; i < animals.length; i++) { // loop that makes i(index) equal 0, and if its less then the animal length, to add 1 int to it. 
	System.out.println(animals(i)); // print out array starting at i(0 in this case) 
}
Would cause an error to to i <= 3 since this list is 0-2, it would cause out of bound error 

**Loop in reverse- Important to memorize this structure** 
String[] animals = {“elephant”, “giraffe”, “aardvark”}; // declaring the variable type:string, variable generally plural, then use curly brackets to full the list. 
For (int i = animals.length-1; i>= 0, i- -) { // loop that makes i(index) equal to array list minus 1(the last index value in the array), then to subtract 1 from its until its 0 
	System.out.println(animals(i)); // print out array starting at i(2 in this case) 
}

**For Each loop ( enhanced for loop)- Important to memorize this structure** 
String[] animals = {“elephant”, “giraffe”, “aardvark”}; // declaring the variable type:string, variable generally plural, then use curly brackets to full the list. 
for (String animal: animals)  { 
System.out.println(animals); // print out array starting at i(0 in this case) 
}
