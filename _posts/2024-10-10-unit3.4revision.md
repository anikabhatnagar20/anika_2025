# 3.4 Else If Statements 
Else If Statements: Used when you have multiple conditions that need to be checked sequentially.

Flow of Execution: Each condition is evaluated in the order written. The first true condition's code runs, and the rest are skipped.

Structure:

- Start with a single if statement.
- Follow with as many else if statements as needed.
- Optionally end with one else to handle any remaining cases.
Key Concept: The order of conditions matters. More specific conditions should come before broader ones to ensure accurate results.


```Java
int myAge = 17; // adjust the age too see the difference in what it prints out
System.out.println("Current age: " + myAge);
if (myAge >= 18) 
{
    System.out.println("You can registar to vote.");
    System.out.println("You are old enough for a license to drive.");
}
else if (myAge >= 16) {
    System.out.println("You are old enough for a license to drive.");
} 
else if (myAge >= 15) {
    System.out.println("You can learn to drive a car.");
}
else if (myAge >= 14) {
    System.out.println("You are 14");
}

```

    Current age: 17
    You are old enough for a license to drive.

## Raise your hand: 
1. If I was 19 what would it print out?
2. If I was 13 what would it print out?

## Popcorn Hack 
Add more statements to make the code print out an "F" and "C"
```Java
public class gradeEvaluator 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
        {
        double myAverage = 90;
        System.out.println("Current average: " + myAverage);
        if (myAverage >= 90)
        {
            System.out.println("You have \"A\" average.");
        }
        
        else if (myAverage >= 80)
        { 
            System.out.println("You have an \"B\" average.");
        }
        //add more letter grade options as needed
    }
}
